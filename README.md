# Dynamic Angular CRUD Service
This project is an attempt at creating a reusable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) data service in Angular to make it easier for performing CRUD operations against many different Database Tables.

# TODO
1. Implement change strategy into "update" methods so that they only perform an update to the database if the front end model has changed.
2. Investigate issues with performing "fetch" based updates.
